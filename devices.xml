  List your DVB devices and their parameters in this file, with one
  "<device>" section for each device. The parameters differ for
  DVB-S/-S2/-C/-T and different DVB frontends may have varying
  autodetection capabilities for certain parameters, so try setting
  additional parameters if tuning doesn't work.

  -->

  <device>
    <frontend>/dev/dvb/adapter0/frontend0</frontend>

    These are example parameters for use with DVB-T.

    Usually, you only need to specify frequency and bandwidth, but
    if you encounter problems, you might want to try the parameters below.

    If you live near Munich, the example parameters might work for you. They
    configure a channel containing an ARD multiplex containing the programs
    "arte", "Phoenix", "EinsPlus" and "Das Erste" (as of 2010-08-27).

    For Germany (and probably most of central Europe), the bandwidth
    is 7 (MHz) for frequencies below 300 MHz and 8 (MHz) otherwise,
    so if you change the frequency, don't forget to adjust the
    bandwidth, too.

    <bandwidth>8</bandwidth>
